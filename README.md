## Compatibility

App tested in iOS emulator

## Available Scripts

### `yarn install`

Installs required npm dependencies

### `yarn start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

#### `yarn run ios`

Like `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `yarn run android`

Like `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
